**Eldiad** is a conlang based on many Western/Northern-European languages.
Sadly, I have not worked on this in quite some time, there is still a lot that needs to be fixed.

#### • [Documentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MrxyKX2T18oo2gWFBczvF3zbGnEAAOSkji3GRbtCR9E/edit?usp=sharing) • {.centered-text}

## Main Features
- **Sound Inventory:**[^1] Eldiad has a worked out sound inventory, based on the [International Phonetics Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), including a chart with the simplified and written form in Eldiad.  
- **Syntax:** Eldiad has a few simple root words with their according translations, and a basic word order [V(A)S(A)O].  
- **Grammar:** Eldiad has 5 worked out types of tenses, including their formation, formation in IPA and an example. On top of that, a suffix for plurality was added.

## WIP?

In case I do ever pick this project back up, I would like to add the following features:  
- **Lore:** Adding a reason as for why there are long vowels (transition from Andetísian and Eldiad)  
- **Vocabulary:** Adding more words to the conlang, making it possible to form proper sentences.  
- **Grammar:** Adding more types of tenses, in order to form different types of sentences.  
- **Documentation:** Making a proper documentation with all of the above included.
